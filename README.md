# US-Gun-Violence-Geospatial
In this notebook we took the dataset provided by gunviolencearchive.org. From the organization's description:
Gun Violence Archive (GVA) is a not for profit corporation formed in 2013 to provide free online public access to accurate information about gun-related violence in the United States. GVA will collect and check for accuracy, comprehensive information about gun-related violence in the U.S. and then post and disseminate it online.
In this notebook, we first got the number of states that had the highest deaths in gun violence related incidents, afterwards we plot a heatmap with gun violence incidents with top hundred most deadly incidents and their location addresses.
